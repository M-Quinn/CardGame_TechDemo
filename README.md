## Description ##
Built in Unity 6, this small tech demo was made to demonstrate the ability to quickly and easily create a card game <b>dynamically</b>.
In most Unity projects, developers will create prefabs or scriptable objects for every single instance of a type of card. Although this does work, it adds a ton of time, overhead, and removes the ability to randomly create cards.

This project utilizes the Decorator Pattern to dynamically create cards using a base item type and multiple modifiers. You can find these items and modifiers inside the project Assets>Card>Scripts. Inside this folder you will find Items and ItemDecorators.
